# FaceRecognitionAndRedaction
The objective of this system is detect faces in real-time, train a Fisher Face Recognizer to train my face using Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimension reduction and redact my face in real-time when multiple faces and objects are present.

This is a Video Analytics and Machine Learning project to understand how to involve machine learning algorithms in an OpenCV project.
