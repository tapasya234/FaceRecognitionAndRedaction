# FaceRecognitionAndRedaction
The objective of this system detects faces in real-time, train a Fisher Face Recognizer to recognize my face using Linear Discriminant Analysis for dimension reduction and redact my face in real-time when many faces and objects are present.

This is a Video Analytics, and Machine Learning combined project to understand how to involve machine learning algorithms in an OpenCV project.
